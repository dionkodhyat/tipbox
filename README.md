# Getting Started with Create React App

This app calls the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos` in a paginated format and renders the photo in a horizontal gallery. Unfortunately, the url for the images are unstable and to address this, an onError handler were created to continously request the image should it fail.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
